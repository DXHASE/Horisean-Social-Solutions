The refactored-code.html file controls the structure of the website and all I had to do was go in and pick out which tags had semantic tags that would help make the code readable. In the code there were a large amount of div tags which i changed to section and article tags in order to save some confusion. On the refactored-style.css file I had to go back to my html file and change the class names of some of the elements in order to be able to style certain parts of the page the same and save time rewritting code that I had already previously written.
